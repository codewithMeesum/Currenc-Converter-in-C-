# Currenc-Converter-in-C-
I'm excited to share my latest mini project – a Currency Converter built using C++

 What it does:
This simple yet functional program converts currency values between different international currencies like USD, EUR, PKR, INR, and more. It's built using core C++ concepts including:

Conditional statements

Switch-case logic

Functions

Loops

User input/output formatting

Why I made it:
As part of my programming fundamentals journey, I wanted to work on a real world problem that would strengthen my logic building skills and practice clean code structure. This project helped me better understand flow control and data manipulation in C++.

 I’d love feedback or suggestions on how to improve or add features!
